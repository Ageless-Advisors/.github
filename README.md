# **Veridocx**  
> *Automating regulatory compliance for medical device innovators.*

---

## **About Us**

**Veridocx** is building an AI-native platform to **streamline the FDA 510(k) submission process** for medical device companies.  
Our mission is to **reduce regulatory burden**, accelerate innovation, and help companies bring life-saving technologies to market faster — without sacrificing safety or compliance.

Today, medical device regulatory processes are **manual, slow, and error-prone**.  
Veridocx leverages **large language models (LLMs)**, **retrieval pipelines**, and **multi-agent systems** to:

- Automate **predicate device search** and **equivalence analysis**.
- Simplify **burden assessments** and documentation.
- Provide clear, auditable, and HIPAA-compliant workflows for regulatory teams.

## **Our Vision**

We believe that:
- **Compliance should empower innovation**, not slow it down.  
- AI can **transform regulatory operations** just as cloud computing transformed infrastructure.  
- Open, secure, and explainable AI systems are critical for **building trust** with regulators and innovators alike.
